> **Abstract:** The pinball loss is favored in support vector machines for its robustness against noise. However, its unbounded nature makes it sensitive to outliers. To address this, a rescaled pinball loss offering boundedness has been introduced. Despite this improvement, the model’s performance may be limited due to restricted parameter adjustments, and its non-differentiability constrains optimization methods. Therefore, we propose a novel smooth rescaled generalized pinball loss, which is more flexible and differentiable. This loss is characterized by properties such as asymmetry, non-convexity, sparsity, boundedness, and differentiability. It is applied to support vector machines and is referred to as SRGP-SVM. Since SRGP-SVM involves a differentiable non-convex optimization problem, we employ modified Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) methods for solving SRGP-SVM to leverage its differentiability. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the model’s performance compared to established models.
